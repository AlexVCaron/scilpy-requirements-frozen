SCILPY Requirements Frozen
==========================

This repository contains frozen requirements for the Scilpy library, 
automatically generated for each release. They are mostly used for docker 
image building purposes.

Each version of the requirements lives on its own branch, and is tagged with 
the associated version as well.
